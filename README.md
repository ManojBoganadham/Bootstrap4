# Front-end web UI frameworks

These UI frameworks are collection of such ready-to-use HTML, CSS, and JS templates for UI components. 
Some of them are Bootstrap, Semantic UI, Foundation, Materialize, Material UI etc.
### Why should I use these frameworks?

- Increased productivity
- Commumnity support (Resources and web page templates)
